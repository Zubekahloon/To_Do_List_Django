# To Do List
## Project Description
Create a To Do List Web Application that runs in the Django. The application should allow users to:

**âœ…**  Add new tasks with a title, description, due date and image.

**âœ…**  Mark tasks as completed.
**âœ…**  Delete tasks.
**âœ…**  Update tasks.
**âœ…**  Save tasks to a file and load.

The Task Data is saved into a JSON/CSV file (savetasksdata.json) using file-handling for easy analysis.
